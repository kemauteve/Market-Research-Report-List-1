<p><strong>The Lumbar Expandable Peek Cage Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spondylolisthesis</li><li>Degenerative Disc Disease</li><li>Disc Prolapse</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lumbar expandable PEEK cage market primarily caters to spinal disorders such as spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease, and disc prolapse. Spondylolisthesis involves the displacement of vertebrae, leading to instability, while degenerative disc disease results in the deterioration of intervertebral discs, causing pain and discomfort. Disc prolapse occurs when disc material herniates, pressing on nerves. These cages are designed to provide structural support and stability during spinal fusion surgery, enhancing recovery and improving patientsâ€™ quality of life. Other applications may include spinal trauma and revisions.</p></p>
