<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Casting Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Casting</li><li>Non-centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum casting services encompass two primary market types: centrifugal casting and non-centrifugal casting. Centrifugal casting utilizes rotational forces to distribute molten material evenly within a mold, producing parts with enhanced density and strength. This method is ideal for cylindrical components. In contrast, non-centrifugal casting relies on gravitational forces, allowing for greater versatility in shapes and sizes. It is commonly used for complex geometries and smaller batches. Both methods cater to diverse industries requiring precision and quality in manufacturing.</p></p>
