<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Restriction Endonucleases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li><li>Type III</li><li>Type IV</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Restriction endonucleases, essential tools in molecular biology, are categorized into four main types. Type I endonucleases cut DNA at sites far from their recognition sequences and require ATP. Type II, the most commonly used, cleave DNA at specific sites within or adjacent to their recognition sequences, making them ideal for genetic engineering. Type III endonucleases cut DNA a short distance from their recognition sites and require ATP but not Mg2+. Type IV endonucleases target modified DNA, such as methylated DNA. Other variants may include newly discovered enzymes with specialized functions.</p></p>
