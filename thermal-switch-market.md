<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open Thermal Switch</li><li>Normally Closed Thermal Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal switch market is categorized into two main types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) thermal switches. Normally Open thermal switches are designed to remain off until a specific temperature threshold is reached, at which point they close the circuit and turn on the device. Conversely, Normally Closed thermal switches are pre-closed and will open to interrupt the circuit when temperatures exceed a predetermined level. Both types are essential in various applications, ensuring safety and efficient temperature control in electrical systems.</p></p>
